# Machine Learning Projects
An ongoing library of my machine learning projects.

## Basics
- [x] MNIST (PyTorch)
- [ ] Pathology Classification for Medical Images (PyTorch)
- [ ] AI Explainability for Multi-label Image Classification
- [ ] Transfer learning for 2D Bounding box detection on new objects
- [ ] Point cloud segmentation for object detection.<sup>1</sup>
- [ ]  **Image semantic segmentation using U-net for binary and multi-class. {ongoing}**
- [ ] Machine Translation for Posture and Intention Classification
- [ ] Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for data augmentation (using Pix2pix model)
- [ ] Using CycleGAN for image transformation


<sup>1</sup>: Implement [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00678v1.pdf) as well
