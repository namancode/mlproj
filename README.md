# Machine Learning Projects
An ongoing library of my machine learning projects.

## Basics
- [ ] MNIST (PyTorch)
- [ ] Pathology Classification for Medical Images (PyTorch)
- [ ] AI Explainability for Multi-label Image Classification
- [ ] Transfer learning for 2D Bounding box detection on new objects
- [ ] Point cloud segmentation for object detection [^1]
- [ ] Image semantic segmentation using U-net for binary and multi-class.
- [ ] Machine Translation for Posture and Intention Classification
- [ ] Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for data augmentation (using Pix2pix model)
- [ ] Using CycleGAN for image transformation
