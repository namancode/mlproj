# Machine Learning Implementations
An ongoing library of my machine learning implementations.

## Basics
- [x] MNIST (PyTorch) - Model and Training
- [x] Image semantic segmentation using U-net for binary and multi-class - Model
- [x] UNets - Model
- [x] [LSTM](nlp/lstm) from scratch - Model and Training
- [x] [Seq2Seq](nlp/seq2seq) - Model and Training
